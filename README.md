👋 Hi there! I'm Álvaro López Maliza, a passionate researcher with a Ph.D. in basic intratumoral immunology, a degree in biology, and currently on the verge of completing a master’s degree in data science 🧑‍🎓. I'm actively on the lookout for a postdoc position that will not only leverage my existing skills but also provide opportunities to delve deeper into omics techniques, especially single-cell RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics 🧬.

My interests thrive at the exciting intersection of immunology and data science 🌐. Proficient in both R and Python, I bring a unique blend of programming skills and a wealth of knowledge in data science techniques, encompassing clustering, machine learning 🤖, and neural networks 🧠.

Let's connect and explore the fascinating realms of data-driven immunology! 🚀
